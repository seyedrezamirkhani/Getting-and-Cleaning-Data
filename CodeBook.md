The tidy data set contains the mean value of variables in the data set produced by the "mean" and "standard deviation" functions, grouped by the experiment subject [identified by unique number] and activity [e.g. Walking, Standing].

This rows in this data set are ordered by subject and activity variables; This was done in order to adhere to the [tidy data paper] (http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) by Hadley Wickham
 *a good ordering makes it easier to scan the raw values*
